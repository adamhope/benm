# Important
- make watch buttons work
- replicate rest of existing functionality
- write tests for all the things! Can we really TDD this way?
- change mongo task to start mongo with a local db directory
- setup instructions

# Adam really wants to do these but they're not as important :-(
- Jasmine not mocha (maybe)
- fonts
- tasks to copy fonts/images etc. not sure if that's all setup
- code coverage checks, are they an option again?
- switch from less to scss
- are html files etc being copied automatically?
